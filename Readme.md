- **Withdraw Money**: 
  - Click "Withdraw" button
  - Enter amount in popup dialog
  - Confirm transaction
- **Deposit Money**: 
  - Click "Deposit" button
  - Enter amount in popup dialog
  - Confirm transaction

### Loan Calculations
1. **Click "Loan"** to enter loan mode
2. **Fill in the required fields**:
   - Number of years
   - Loan amount
3. **Click "Calculate Loan"** to compute payments
4. **Generate Receipt** for documentation
5. **Reset** to clear all fields

### Keypad Functions

- **#**: Reserved for future functionality

## Interface Overview

The application features a professional dual-panel design:

### Left Panel - ATM Operations
- **Function Buttons**: Balance, Withdraw, Loan, Deposit
- **PIN Display Area**: Shows entered PIN (masked) and status messages
- **Numeric Keypad**: Complete 4x4 button layout with color-coded controls

### Right Panel - Loan Management  
- **Input Fields**: Interest rate, Number of years, Loan amount
- **Calculation Results**: Monthly payment, Total payment (read-only)
- **Action Buttons**: Calculate, Reset, Receipt, Exit
- **Receipt Area**: Large text area for detailed loan receipts

## Default Configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Default PIN | 1234 |
| Initial Balance | ¬£1000.00 |
| Max PIN Attempts | 3 |
| Currency | GBP (¬£) |

## Security Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Security Information**:
- The default PIN (1234) is hardcoded for demonstration purposes
- In a production environment, PINs should be:
  - Stored securely (encrypted/hashed)
  - Retrieved from a secure database
  - Never hardcoded in source code
- Account lockout requires manual reset (contact bank simulation)

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- **Invalid PIN entries** with attempt tracking
- **Insufficient funds** protection
- **Invalid input validation** for all numeric fields
- **Empty field validation** for loan calculations
- **Mathematical errors** in loan computations

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components
- **ATMS.java**: Main application class with GUI and business logic
- **Swing Components**: Professional UI with panels and controls
- **Event Handling**: Comprehensive button and input event management
- **Input Validation**: Robust data validation for all user inputs

### Key Classes & Methods
- `jbtnEnterActionPerformed()`: PIN authentication logic
- `jbtnBalanceActionPerformed()`: Balance inquiry
- `jbtnWithdrawActionPerformed()`: Withdrawal processing
- `jbtnDepositActionPerformed()`: Deposit processing
- `jLoanCalActionPerformed()`: Loan calculation engine
- `jReceiptActionPerformed()`: Receipt generation

## Loan Calculation Formula

The system uses the standard loan payment formula:

```
Monthly Payment = P √ó r √ó (1 + r)^n / ((1 + r)^n - 1)
```

Where:
- P = Principal loan amount
- r = Monthly interest rate (annual rate / 12 / 100)
- n = Total number of payments (years √ó 12)

For zero-interest loans: `Monthly Payment = Principal / Number of Months`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Application won't start**:
- Verify Java installation: `java -version`
- Check classpath configuration
- Ensure all files are in correct directories

**PIN not accepted**:
- Default PIN is `1234`
- Check for numeric input only
- Verify Enter button functionality

**Loan calculations incorrect**:
- Verify all fields contain valid positive numbers
- Check for proper decimal formatting
- Ensure interest rate is annual percentage

**Display issues**:
- Check system display scaling
- Verify Swing/AWT compatibility
- Update Java to latest version
